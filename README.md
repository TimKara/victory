# Victory

Chaos is past. Victory is present.

Victory makes volunteer management awesome. It keeps track of applications, teams and contact information. Its interface is responsive and a pleasure to use, making a once complicated task the easiest thing in the world.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Start by setting up your virtualenv:

```
$ virtualenv venv
```

Then activate it:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you're ready to install the requirements:

```

Then do regular Django stuff. This will be elaborated later.
